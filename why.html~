          <p>
            While using bitcoins is an excellent way to make your purchases, donations, and p2p payments, without losing money through inflated transaction fees, transactions are never truly anonymous. Bitcoin activities are recorded and available publicly via the blockchain; a comprehensive database which keeps a record of bitcoin transactions.
          </p>
	  <p>
            All exchanges require the user to scan ID documents, and large transactions must be reported to the proper governmental authority. When you use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, you will of course need to provide your name and address to the seller for delivery purposes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            This means that a third party with an interest in tracking your activities can use your visible balance and ID information as a basis from which to track your future transactions or to study previous activity. In short, you have compromised your security and privacy.
	  </p>
            
	  <p>
	    To avoid this, we recommend using a quality mixing service such as the one we provide to periodically exchange your bitcoins for different ones which cannot be associated with the original owner. In order to further enhance the security of your transactions we provide the opportunity to use two or more forward addresses as well as convenient time delays. In addition, we immediately delete all archival logs related to your transactions.
